    should create an ExampleGroup that includes RSpec::Stepwise
  with Stepwise included
    should retain instance variables between steps
    should mark later examples as pending if one fails
    should allow nested steps
    should not allow nested normal contexts (PENDING: A correct approach - in the meantime, this behavior is undefined)
